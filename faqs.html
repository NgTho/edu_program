									<div class="link"><i class="fa fa-question" aria-hidden="true"></i> What is normal skin?<i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></div>
									<div class="submenu">
										<p> Skin is the largest organ of the human body. It makes up about 15% of your total body weight. It is important as it is your first line of defense against germs, protects the internal parts of your body, prevents water loss and protects your body from the damaging sun. Your skin consists of three layers. The epidermis is the outside layer. <br>
										The dermis is the middle layer and has your nerves, sweat glands and blood vessels. The subcutaneous layer is the inner layer that contains supporting fibers and larger blood vessels.</p>
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="link"><i class="fa fa-question" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Why do scars happen?<i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></div>
									<div class="submenu">
										<p> Trauma to the skin can effect at least one layer of skin. The healing process occurs immediately as does bleeding. The bleeding is stopped by blood clot formation. The area then becomes swollen and sore. As the skin heals, small tissue fibers form, eventually becoming solid tissue that may or may not form a scar.</p>
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="link"><i class="fa fa-question" aria-hidden="true"></i> Why do only some people develop scars?<i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></div>
									<div class="submenu">
										<p> Scarring is part of the natural healing process. Some people are more likely to get scars as a result of their personal history or medical conditions. Other factors that lead to the development of scars are poor nutrition, skin coloration and age.</p>
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<div class="link"><i class="fa fa-question" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Why do our scar treatment products work?<i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></div>
									<div class="submenu">
										<p> Here are 2 theories as to why the product works: The skin attempts to maintain or re-achieve its homeostasis and probably sends too many fibroblasts to the wound. <br>
										This accounts for why they mount up in their random fashion. There also exists a certain tension on the skin. If one were to lightly touch a drop of liquid mercury, it can be done without disturbing its shape due to its high degree of surface tension. This is a possible factor the skin takes into account with the Scar Fx® product. <br>
										The other theory is that the Scar Fx® Silicone Scar Therapy effect on scar tissue is due to the generation of static electricity between the scar and the silicone sheet. This charge provides a stimulus to the collagen that has been overproduced. It is this overproduction that provides this visible scar. This stimulation caused the skin to sort of wake up and realize it is abnormal. The result is a softer and smoother scar as well as being less noticeable</p>

								<li>
									<div class="link"><i class="fa fa-question" aria-hidden="true"></i>  Do silicone scar sheets work?<i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></div>
									<div class="submenu">
										<p> Silicone scar sheets help keep a scar hydrated, making it more likely to heal. The sheeting also helps keep the area clean and free of bacteria, while still allowing oxygen to reach the skin. The support provided by the silicone sheet also helps keep the scar from stretching. <br><br>
